 GAN Question: Read the GANs paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) or the blog post https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-generative-adversarial-networksgans-cd6e4651a29 to answer the following questions: 

1. Explain the different loss terms in the GANs loss function. 
2. Explain the concept of mode collapse in GANs. 
3. Explain the concept of latent space in GANs and latent space interpolation. 
4.  Is training a generative adversarial network stable?
