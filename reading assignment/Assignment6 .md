3D Deep Learning Question: Read the PointNet (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593) and DGCNN paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829 to answer the following questions: PointNet 

Questions: 

1. How does PointNet handle the problem of permutation invariance in point cloud data, and what are the advantages of this approach? 

2. Can you describe the architecture of PointNet and explain how it processes point cloud data? 

3. How does the max pooling operation in PointNet help to aggregate information from multiple points, and how does it differ from other pooling operations in deep learning? 



DGCNN Questions:

1. How does DGCNN handle the problem of non-uniform sampling in 3D point clouds, and what are the advantages of this approach? 
2. Can you describe the dynamic graph construction process in DGCNN, and how it captures local and global spatial relationships between points? 
3. How does the dynamic graph pooling operation in DGCNN work, and how does it help to reduce the computational cost of processing large point clouds?
